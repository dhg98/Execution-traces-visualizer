## Examples and tutorials

- [Collapsible tree example](https://observablehq.com/@d3/collapsible-tree) -> ISC License by [Mike Bostock](https://observablehq.com/@mbostock).

    From this example I've taken the idea to structure the code as it is there, with the update function taking the responsibility to change the appearance of the tree in SVG.

- [D3.js Tree Layout chart](https://codepen.io/augbog/pen/LEXZKK)

    From this example I've taken the layout of the tree (vertical rather than horizontal, as it is in the previous example).
